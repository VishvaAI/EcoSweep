We are prticipating in the Vikshit Bharath Buildathon 2025 and this our porject for the same.

Our aim is to make India Aatmanirbhar and Samridh
This is an eco-friendly trash collecting robot which detects trash based on its recyclability and segregates trash. This solves one of the main problem in India which is waste managemet.
Our poject aims to reduce manual labour and improve security in this sector.

Our project uses a pretrained image dectection model to detect trash and classify it. The robot then goes near the rash and sucks it in using a vacuum motor and the trash gets segregated in to different bins using a computer controlled flap.

We hope u like our project!
